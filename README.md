# drtools-metric  

The drtools-metric was born from the need to be a simple tool that could help the developer with his daily work.
The vast majority of metric tools are server-side, requiring multiple configurations and environments to use. 
The drtools-metric came up with this approach as a premise: simplicity. For this reason, it is a CLI (command-line interface) tool.
